# CSB310_Alternative-Language-Project

###  Programming Language Chosen
**Kotlin 1.9.x**  
Kotlin is a modern, statically typed programming language developed by JetBrains. It runs on the JVM and is fully interoperable with Java, but features cleaner syntax, null safety, and strong type inference.

### Why Kotlin?
I chose Kotlin because:
- It is widely used in **Android development** and increasingly in backend/server-side applications.
- It combines the **conciseness** of scripting languages like Python with the **performance and structure** of Java.
- Its **expressive syntax** and functional programming support make data manipulation more intuitive.

## üß± How Kotlin Handles Core Programming Concepts

| Concept                               | Kotlin Support                                                                                                                |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Object-Oriented Programming**       | Fully supported: classes, inheritance, interfaces, and encapsulation.                                                         |
| **File Ingestion**                    | Built-in libraries and extensions make reading CSVs straightforward using `BufferedReader`, Kotlin I/O, or external CSV libs. |
| **Conditional Statements & Loops**    | Supports `if`, `when`, `for`, `while`, and `do-while`.                                                                        |
| **Assignment & Variable Declaration** | Uses `val` (immutable) and `var` (mutable). Strong type inference.                                                            |
| **Subprograms (Functions/Methods)**   | Functions are first-class citizens, and support named/optional parameters and lambda expressions.                             |
| **Exception Handling**                | Supports `try-catch-finally`, and throws exceptions similar to Java.                                                          |
| **Unit Testing**                      | Works with `JUnit`, `Kotest`, or `Spek`. Test classes are placed under `src/test/kotlin/`.                                    |

## üìö Libraries Used

1. **kotlin.io / java.io**  
   Used for reading the CSV file (`BufferedReader`) from the resources' folder.

2. **Regex (Kotlin stdlib)**  
   Used extensively for data cleaning, such as extracting years, weights, and numeric values from strings.
